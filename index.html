            <p>My name is Barbara Whiting. My mom and dad raised me first in Florida and then for the remainder of my
                school years in Michigan. Immediately upon becoming an adult I moved West to Colorado, so while I am
                not a native, I feel like one. I enjoy many things that Colorado has to offer such as hiking, biking
                the many trails, and winter activities as well. I am married and we have a 15 year old son, named
                Malcolm,
                who is learning to drive. We have two pets, an Australian Cattledog named Friday and a cat named
                Wednesday.

            <br>
            <p>I am currently learning Full Stack Development through the Coding Bootcamp at Denver University. I am
                under
                the instruction of a fantastic teacher and three phenomenal TAs. ;) I am looking forward to all I will
                learn
                and the new career opportunities this will aford me.</p>
